# Smart-Disease-Predictor


This project is based on machine learning, in which the user is able to give input to a model using a graphical user interface, the model is created by first creating a dataset and preprocessing it. We have analyzed a variety of classifiers like CNN, Bayer's, decision tree, random forest etc., and selected the best among them to classify the dataset. This model is done using decision tree which had the highest accuracy among other classifier models.Language: Python
